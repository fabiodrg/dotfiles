# Firefox settings

The `user.js` contains personal settings for Firefox. It overrides the settings in `prefs.js`, the file managed by Firefox: contains the defaults, system-specific settings (not portable) and manual changes in `about:config`. The `user.js` overrides those settings, and my intention is to only override generic settings, so that I can apply it on different systems.

Each profile has its own directory and settings. To find it, go to `about:support`.
